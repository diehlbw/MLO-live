# Sentiment Analysis webapp prototype
## Usage
Currently the app uses fastAPI but no real front-end besides swagger docs.
This project is an work in progress as class introduces further complexity to add to it; see week specific details for how to deploy.
â€¼ Not guaranteed to be backwards compatible, so see commit dates in GitLab if you *really* want old functionality.

Once the server is up (depending on the week's detailed instructions):
1. Use your favorite browser to navigate to \<publicIP\>:8080/docs
0. Use the /analyze endpoint and "Try it out" for example sentiment analysis
   * Update the value for query_string
   * View score and label for results


## Week 4 - containerization
### Option 1. Local deployment (ECR access)
1. From a prompt, it can be pulled and spun up in a single command:  
  `docker run -p 8080:8080 public.ecr.aws/d4e8a7g0/bwd/mlo-live:wk4`

### Option 2. Local deployment with local image build
If you don't have access to the ECR you need to build this locally:
1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project root
2. From a prompt run:  
  `$ docker build -t bwd-sentiment:local`
  `$ docker run -p 8080:8080 bwd-sentiment:local`


## Week 3 - local env
The following may already be available via 44.201.231.8, but somewhat unlikely that the app is still running...

### Manual pre-setup, from project root:
This avoids anaconda because there is too much bloat for the micro EC2 instance to have room for that AND the  (sometimes) actually required torch/transformers libraries

0. python3 -m venv env
0. source env/bin/activate
0. pip install -r api/requirements.txt

### Actually spin up:
1. uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
